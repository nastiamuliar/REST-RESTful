# REST. RESTful services.

**REST**, or **REpresentational State Transfer**, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST does not enforce any rule regarding how it should be implemented at the lower level, it just put high-level design guidelines and leaves us to think of our own implementation.

Services developed in accordance with REST architecture are called **Restful** Web Services. RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

#### REST defines 6 architectural constraints

1. Uniform Interface
  
  **This rule has been described with 4 sub-items.**
  
  * Resource identification in requests
  * Resource manipulation through representations
  * Self-descriptive messages
  * Hypermedia as the engine of application 

2. Client Server Architecture
3. Stateless
4. Cacheable
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand (optional)
